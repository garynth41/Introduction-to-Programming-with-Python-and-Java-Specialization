# Inheritance and Data Structures in Java


# About this Course

This course provides a comprehensive look at Java inheritance, including access modifiers and overriding methods.  Students are introduced to abstract classes, and will learn how to read and write to files, use regular expressions for parsing text, and how to leverage complex data structures like collections and maps.  

Additionally, this course offers strategies for catching errors and debugging code, including an overview of Eclipseâ€™s debugging tool.
